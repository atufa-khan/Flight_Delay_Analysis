# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis Using Python

## 📌 Overview
This project explores a real-world flight delay dataset to identify patterns and factors contributing to delays in air travel. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights using data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to better understand delay behavior across airlines, airports, and time.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

- ✅ Data cleaning and type conversions  
- 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 📊 Visualizations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`  
- 🔍 Aggregation and comparison by carrier, airport, and time  
- 🌡️ Correlation heatmap between various delay causes and total delay

## 📌 Key Findings

1. **Average Arrival Delay by Airline**  
   Some airlines consistently show higher average delays, highlighting operational inefficiencies.

2. **Average Arrival Delay by Month**  
   Seasonal trends observed — with higher delays during certain months (e.g., winter holidays, monsoon).

3. **Average Delay Distribution by Airport**  
   Major airports tend to have higher delay variance compared to regional ones.

4. **Correlation Heatmap**  
   Strong correlations found between `arr_delay` and delay components like `late_aircraft_delay` and `carrier_delay`.
